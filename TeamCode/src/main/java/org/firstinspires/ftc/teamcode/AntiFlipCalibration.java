/*
 * This file contains an example of an iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When a selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * This particular OpMode just executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a two wheeled robot
 * It includes all the skeletal structure that all iterative OpModes contain.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

/*
This opmode is used to calibrate the AntiFlipCalibration system so that we can prevent coach eric from adding 
20 lbs to the robot to prevent it from flipping

use controller 1 to move the robot and move the lift
controller 2 controls the minimum height for when the system actually acivates and slows down the movement
also calibrates the modifier and how strong it is
